# Free ICC

## Description
In this repository you can find ICC profiles and color correction LUTs for various equipment that I had chance to get my hands on. I use them mostly my own work.

Use with caution because - as with all color matching - there are tiny details like ambient light temperature and level in your location, which might make my profiles not work for you.

## Calibration devices used

* X-Rite i1Display Pro (MacBook Pro "staingate" Retina model with removed coating)
* Datacolor SpyderX Pro (BMD Blackmagic SmartView 4K)

## Display devices
* **Apple MacBook Pro** (2015) - unfamous staingate retina model. Screen with the antiglare coating removed mechanically, which made the picture a bit colder thus it needed correction.
* **BMD SmartView 4K** - the "best" BMD video monitor with unknown colorspace coverage. Seems to be D93 at first glance, which is uncommon for a video monitor.
