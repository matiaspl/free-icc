In this repository you can find ICC profiles and color correction LUTs for various equipment that I had chance to get my hands on. I use them mostly my own work.

Use with caution because - as with all color matching - there are tiny details like ambient light temperature and level in your location, which might make my profiles not work for you.

Calibration devices used:

- X-Rite i1Display Pro (MacBook Pro "staingate" Retina model with removed coating)
- Datacolor SpyderX Pro (BMD Blackmagic SmartView 4K)
